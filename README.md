# Boston-House-Data

Key Features of the Code

The provided R code implements a machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

Data Preparation and Exploration:

Data Loading: The code begins by loading the Boston Housing dataset from a specified local path.
Data Exploration: Basic statistical summaries are computed using the summary function to understand the distribution of variables. Pairwise scatterplots are created using the pairs function to visualize relationships between variables.
Model Building and Training:

Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using the createDataPartition function. This ensures a fair evaluation of the models.
Linear Regression: A linear regression model is fitted to the training data using the lm function. This model assumes a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable (house price).
Random Forest: A random forest model is trained using the randomForest function. This ensemble method combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Model Evaluation:

Prediction: Both the linear regression and random forest models are used to make predictions on the testing set.
Performance Metrics: The postResample function is used to calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared for both models. RMSE measures the average magnitude of the errors, while R-squared indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.
Visualization: The predicted and actual house prices are plotted for both models. This visual comparison helps in understanding the model's performance and identifying potential biases.
Key Takeaways:

Model Comparison: The code compares the performance of linear regression and random forest models for predicting house prices.
Data-Driven Approach: The use of statistical summaries and visualizations helps in understanding the data and making informed decisions.
Clear Code Structure: The code is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear variable names and comments.
Comprehensive Evaluation: The models are evaluated using both quantitative metrics and visual inspection.
Library Usage: The code leverages popular R libraries like MASS, caret, e1071, and randomForest for data analysis and machine learning tasks.
This code provides a solid foundation for understanding and applying machine learning techniques to regression problems in R. It demonstrates the importance of data exploration, model selection, and evaluation in building effective predictive models.
